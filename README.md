# RestAPI

--> The purpose of the application is to create a User Rest API with SQLite and JSON Serialization using C#.

With this application, it will be possible to add, remove, view and update users on the SQLite Database from the Postman or Command Shell system.
You can see the screenshots for better understanding:
